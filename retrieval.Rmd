## Retrieval

-   Move bait based on reaction speed (temperature?)
-   if rod tip is jumping it means that it is bumping stuff on the bottom.
-   Dont want a heavy jighead in grass because it will get down on bottom and caught up 
-   Can work it slower because it doesnt drop
-   Tide coming in, cast beyond fish, let current bring shrimp back as you twitch it
-   With shad, you can feel the tail moving when you twitch it, then let it drop, repeat for yo-yo action

### Grass flats
-   Candycorn cal flutetail, let it drop and then bounce it on the retrieve

## Landing

-   Whichever direction the fish swims, pull against it
-   If a fish jumps (tarpon...!) stab it (lower and point rod straight at fish) straight at the them
